Note that, although I'm representing a board square as -1/0/+1 for empty/X/O respectively, trying to cram this information into a single square assumes that \"empty\" is the opposite of \"O\".  Even if I re-ordered so \"X\" could be the opposite of \"O\", this will still cause strange interactions that will make the network ineffective (try it and see for yourself!).\n",

    "### Initiative is encoded by duplicating the entire game state\n",

    "Obviously, initiative (whose turn it is to move) is incredibly important.  I encoded this by duplicating the entire board state, and only activating one of the copies at a time.  This is similar to having a separate DNN for player X and player O, except that by having a single network, it can learn some common ideas.  I believe having two separate networks would actually perform better, but haven't tried it.\n",
